# Ask Finance - better than money

Ask Finance defines a conversational structure as an alternative solution to social coordination. We expect this to be more efficient, effective, and humane than money or every other political system humanity tried out yet.

However, the efficiency gain only shines through once the network has a larger user base. Until then, the code can be used to run trading bots. If you want to do that, get familiar with the [AskFi SDK](https://github.com/BrunoZell/AskFi.Sdk) and [AskFi Runtime](https://github.com/BrunoZell/AskFi.Runtime).
